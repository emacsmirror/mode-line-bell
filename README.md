# Flash the Emacs mode line instead of ringing the bell

## Installation

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of
`package.el` you can install `mode-line-bell` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
`mode-line-bell` there will always be up-to-date.

Enable `mode-line-bell-mode` with `M-x mode-line-bell-mode`, by using
the customisation interface, or by adding code such as the following
to your emacs startup file:

```elisp
(mode-line-bell-mode)
```

### Manual

Ensure `mode-line-bell.el` is in a directory on your load-path, and
add the following to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
(require 'mode-line-bell)
(mode-line-bell-mode)
```
